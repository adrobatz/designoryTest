# designoryTest

Approach for Designory Test:

I started by opening the file in Photoshop to get an idea of how the pieces were broken out. I measured out
the different pieces to see how this could be realigned for mobile. From there I built out the skeleton of the 
project with HTML and sectioned it out in a way that would translate to both small and large screen by assigning 
classes and using certain relevant HTML tags. 
Next, I took the different components of the skeleton and (mentally) grouped them together to see where variables
for SASS would make the most sense. E.G. I looked at all of my text tags and classes and decided which font-size
would be as close to middle of the road as possible so it could easily be manipulated throughout the CSS. I picked
a few main CSS properties to assign variables to since it was a smaller scale project, it didn't seem necessary
to create too many. 
Once this was decided, I started styling the page for mobile. I had each section stack on top of each other, 
and modified the nav slightly to better accommodate mobile. Once that was built out, I scaled it up for medium/
large screen and modified the CSS accordingly. The design of the page was clean enough that I didn't find it was
necessary to adjust the size of fonts or sections for each screen; I felt it translated nicely across the 
different sizes.
